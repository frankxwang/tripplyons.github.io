			<div class="larger">What is a learning style?</div>
			A learning style is a way that one learns best.<br />
			<b>4 major learning styles are:</b>
			<br />
			<br /><b>Visual</b>
			<br /><b>Auditory</b>
			<br /><b>Read-Write</b>
			<br /><b>Kinesthetic</b>
			<br /><br />
			<div class="larger">What is my most preffered learning style?</div>
			I consider myself a Read-Write learner.
			<br />
			<b>Some ways that I learn best are:</b>
			<br />
			<br /><b>Typing</b>
			<br /><b>Reading</b>
			<br /><b>Writing</b>
			<br /><b>Taking Notes</b>
			<br /><b>Coding</b><br />(I normally can't do this one, except for this assignment)
			<br /><br />
			<div class="larger">What is my least preffered learning style?</div>
			My least preferred learning style is Kinesthetic.
			<br /><b>Some things that I can do to adjust to be Kinesthetic are:</b>
			<br />
			<br /><b>Exercising</b>
			<br /><b>Meditating By Focusing On My Body</b>
			<br /><b>Doing Sports</b>
			<br /><br />

			<div class="larger">Summary</div>
			<div class="body">
				All of us learn differently, but most of us fall into four different categories of <b>learning styles</b>:
				<br />
				<br /><b>Visual</b>
				<br /><b>Auditory</b>
				<br /><b>Read-Write</b>
				<br /><b>Kinesthetic</b>
				<br /><br />
				I work best as a <b>Read-Write</b> learner. For me this means that I <b>learn best by</b>:
				<br />
				<br /><b>Typing</b>
				<br /><b>Reading</b>
				<br /><b>Writing</b>
				<br /><b>Taking Notes</b>
				<br /><b>Coding</b><br />(Which I normally can't do except for this assignment)
				<br /><br />
				I don't work as well as a <b>Kinesthetic</b> learner.
				<br />I can <b>improve</b> by:
				<br />
				<br /><b>Exercising</b>
				<br /><b>Meditating By Focusing On My Body</b>
				<br /><b>Doing Sports</b>
				<br /><br />
				<br />
				Learning is important, and I hope to get better at it. I can do this by knowing my strengths and weaknesses. I hope to heighten my abilities in <b>not one, but all</b> learning styles.
