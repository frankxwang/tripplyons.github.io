            The book <i>Who is Bill Gates?</i>, By Patricia Brennan Demuth, shows that you can accomplish a lot with perserverance and hard work.
            Bill was very interested in learning as a kid. He read the entire <i>World Book Encyclopedia</i> when he was 7.
            He started in Lakeside, a private school, in 7th grade. It turned out to be a great choice, that would forever change his life.
            It was there that he had access to a Teletype computer. At the time most colleges didn't even have computers.
            This allowed him to dive deep into the world of computer programming. A lot like Bill Gates, I feel fortunate to have computers around 
            me, and I am able to do computer programming.
            <br />
            <br />Later, as Bill went to Harvard, he discovered the Altair 8800 on the cover of <i>Popular Electronics</i>, 
            during January 1975 in his sophomore year. He, and his friend Paul Allen, who was also from Lakeside, decided to write a
            programming language for the new computer. Bill contacted the company that made the Altair, and sold their software to them.
            Microsoft was born.
            <br />
            <br />Bill ended up making a lot of money, and decided to donate 95% of it. He started a foundation to help the world. 
            His foundation focuses on health, education, and poverty.
